summary: |
  Apache ZooKeeper is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source server
  which enables highly reliable distributed coordination.
description: |
  ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information,
  naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.
  All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed
  applications. Each time they are implemented there is a lot of work that goes
  into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable.
  Because of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications
  initially usually skimp on them, which make them brittle in the presence of
  change and difficult to manage. Even when done correctly, different
  implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the 
  applications are deployed.
